# BIGProject
Website for internal tracking of projects

This was my main project during my iternship in the Compass Business Intelligence department during my fall/winter quarter of my senior year at North Seattle College. <br />
I developed this in PHP, HTML, a little bit of JavaScript using MySQL database. <br />
I was responsible for the creation and schema of the databse used in the project. <br />
The reason I chose PHP, and HTML was because this web page would require some backend processing, also PHP is the language that I had used in school to develop a web application in my junior year


This project also had the requirement of being hosted on Azure.  I was responsible for setting up the resource group for the project which included
Web App Service, MySQL database, and integration with Github for CI/CD which allowed for instant updates of the site when new code was
pushed to the production branch, after testing and approval.
